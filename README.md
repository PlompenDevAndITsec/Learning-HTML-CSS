# Learning-HTML-CSS With SuperSimpleDev
With a guide from SuperSimpleDev I am learning HTML &amp; CSS and hope to later move into JS for CyberSecurity.

Be Sure to check out his website:
https://supersimple.dev/

and his repository for this project: 
https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev/html-css-course-2022/tree/main

-------------------------
For this project I didn't decide to start uploading untill lesson-04 so everything before that will be a bit messy.
For timesake I will probably not clean this up.
